## Description

> This Package`s origin started during the implementation of the Tech Demo **["Blocket"](https://github.com/blocketGame/Blocket)**, an 2D open world adventure filled with dungeons, bosses and many structures to explore.

It includes several implementations of procedural generation in a 2D space and examples explaining those.
